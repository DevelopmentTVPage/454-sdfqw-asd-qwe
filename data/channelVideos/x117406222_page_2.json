Hey guys, today were are going to recreate the opening battle in Gladiator using the Rise and Fall Gladiator mod.  It took us a couple tries to get it right, but I think you are really going to enjoy this one.  Players will fight as Roman infantry and cavalry as one team.  And the other players will fight as the Germanic tribes.  I will play as all three so you see what it is like to fight as all three.
